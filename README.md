## Description

This API is used to serve shared scripts with other authenticated users alongside our own authentication service. 

Some features:
1. Storing meta-data of shared scripts:
    - stars
    - comments
    - number of downloads
2. Restricted connection with remote mongodb cluster in such a way that it is limited to the collections it will deal with.
3. Connection with auth client/service so that it may safely comminicate with other services.
